## Note for Streamlit Users
If you want to run the Streamlit app **locally**, you will need to create your own `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in the root directory to securely store API keys and other secrets. For example:

### Example `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:
```toml
[openai]
api_key = "your-openai-api-key-here"
```

Make sure to replace `"your-openai-api-key-here"` with your actual API key.
